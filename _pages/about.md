I got my Bsc. Engineering on Software Engineering in Tianjin University at 2017 fall. Here I'm also minored in financial management. 
Now I am an intern computer vision researcher, supervised by Dr. Junjie Yan at SenseTime and do research about face recognition and deep learning.
I am also a visiting student at Multimedia Lab, supervised by Prof. Yu Qiao, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
I love playing the piano and photograph. I'll be very happy if we can talk about these.

Research
======
I am interested in **deep learning** and its applications on **computer vision** for face recognition. I expect to do some end-to-end research in these areas.
I also interested in reinforcement learning, machine learning and information visualization.
